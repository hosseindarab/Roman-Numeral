## How to Use Next.js

Quickly get started using [Create Next App](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app#readme)!

In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app

```

## Run Jest Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## How to run the application

After pulling the application in your local machine, open your terminal and run the following command in
the right directory(for example C:\dev\Roman Numeral\with-jest-app):

```bash
npm run dev
